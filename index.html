After being affected by a disastrous event involving machines, Mondragón has a strong dislike for technology and humanity, believing herself and her fellow Radiants to be the true future for Earth. Reyna takes what she wants when she wants it, no matter who is standing in her way. Savage and almost animalistic, she is not one to hesitate when it comes to eliminating her enemies and getting blood on her hands. She has a strong dislike for technology and thrives on the enemy's misery, and loves to compete with fellow Radiants to see who is the most powerful.</strong></center></p>

He has a limited memory of his past, though he does remember being involved in something that caused him to be ripped apart and killed. A living nightmare, Omen takes full advantage of his shadowed physique and will not hesitate to eliminate his enemies using the forces of paranoia and fear. He is cynical in nature, which stems from him experiencing extreme pain as he was condemned to remain in the state that he is today. If there's one person who wants to know more about his mysterious circumstances, it's Omen himself - and quite desperately so.Despite his fearsome nature, Omen shows some friendliness towards people he knows well such as Viper, shown by being able to call her by her real name despite her warning other agents to never do so. </strong></center></p>

Previously property of K-SEC, these radivores now live with Gekko, often traveling with him wherever he goes within their small carrier that Gekko wears as a sash, from which they'll emerge and take form at a moment's notice to assist him.. Gekko is a relaxed, supportive and kind person. He encourages his team to work together and compliments them whenever they complete a task or impress him. He cares about the safety of his team, and is receptive towards his teammates' ideas and opinions.</strong></center></p>

His continued passion to gather whatever information he can find is not always shared by his teammates, as Jett found out the hard way during an undercover mission in Los Angeles. He keeps most of this information to himself, making sure that no one ever discovers them and only revealing anything he knows for a price. In contrast of how he knows a lot about his allies, they do not know much about him, and he prefers to keep it that way. While Cypher has a history of being a killer, he has shown to have warmer ties with some of the agents in the Protocol, to the point of referring to them by nicknames. </strong></center></p>

With her affinity to feel and sense the natural world and everything else around her, Skye is naturally observant, and will quickly note whenever she senses something unusual with her surroundings. Naturally a hard worker due to growing up in a farm, Skye seems to want to influence her teammates to be the same, as she apparently holds a woodworking class by the mess hall of their headquarters to practice having nimble minds through nimble hands. </strong></center></p>
